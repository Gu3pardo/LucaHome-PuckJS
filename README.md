## Home Assistant

PuckJs-Beacons are now integrated into my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) using the integration for [Eddystones](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/eddystone_temperature/) to read out the values.

## Archived

Originally planned as part of the LucaHome-Project.
JavaScript to control a PuckJS. Shall read out battery, temperature, light and magnetometer to broadcast via bluetooth LE.
Further plans were:
-	provide LucaHome Website IP via NFC and BLE
-	use a number of PuckJS to provide indoor navigation for an android application
-	possible IR control of TV
